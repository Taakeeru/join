        </p>
        <h3>
          General Notes on the Legal Bases for Data Processing on this Website
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you have given your consent to data processing, we will process
          your personal data based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 Para.
          2 lit. a GDPR if special categories of data are processed. In the case
          of an express consent to the transfer of personal data to third
          countries, the processing is carried out based on Art. 49 Para. 1 lit.
          a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to
          information on your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the
          processing will also take place based on § 25 Para. 1 TTDSG. Consent
          can be revoked at any time. If your data is processed to fulfill a
          contract or to carry out pre-contractual measures, the processing is
          based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data
          if this is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6
          Para. 1 lit. c GDPR. The data processing can also be carried out based
          on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
          Information on the respective legal bases in individual cases is
          provided in the following sections of this privacy policy.
        </p>
        <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
        <p>
          In the course of our business activities, we collaborate with various
          external entities. In some cases, the transmission of personal data to
          these external entities is necessary. We only disclose personal data
          to external entities if it is necessary for the fulfillment of a
          contract, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., disclosure of data
          to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest according to
          Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR in the disclosure, or if another legal
          basis allows the data transfer. When using processors, we only
          disclose personal data of our customers based on a valid contract for
          order processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract for
          joint processing is concluded.
        </p>
        <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
        <p>
          Many data processing operations are only possible with your express
          consent. You can revoke consent already given at any time. The
          legality of the data processing carried out before the revocation
          remains unaffected by the revocation.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and Direct
          Marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)
        </h3>
        <p>
          IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU
          HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT
          ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO
          APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL
          BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS DATA
          PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR
          AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE CAN PROVE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE
          GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND
          FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE, OR DEFEND
          LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
          IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU
          HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL
          DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO
          APPLIES TO PROFILING, INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT
          MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO
          LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO
          ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).
        </p>
        <h3>Right to File Complaints with Regulatory Authorities</h3>
        <p>
          In the event of breaches of data protection law, the data subject has
          the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory
          authority. The competent supervisory authority for data protection
          issues is the data protection officer of the federal state in which
          our company is based. A list of data protection officers and their
          contact details can be found at the following link:

        </p>
        <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the
          basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to
          you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you
          request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party,
          this will only be done if it is technically feasible.
        </p>
        <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
        <p>
          This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the
          protection of the transmission of confidential content, such as the
          inquiries you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an
          encrypted connection in your browser's address line when it changes
          from "http://" to "https://" and the lock icon is displayed in your
          browser's address bar. If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data
          you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
        </p>
        <h3>Encrypted Payments on this Website</h3>
        <p>
          If there is an obligation to provide us with your payment data (e.g.,
          account number for direct debit authorization) after the conclusion of
          a fee-based contract, this data is required for payment processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Payment transactions using common means of payment (Visa/MasterCard,
          direct debit) are made exclusively via an encrypted SSL or TLS
          connection. You can recognize an encrypted connection in your
          browser's address line when it changes from "http://" to "https://"
          and the lock icon is displayed in your browser's address bar. With
          encrypted communication, your payment data that you transmit to us
          cannot be read by third parties.
        </p>
        <h3>Information, Deletion, and Correction</h3>
        <p>
          Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the
          right to obtain information free of charge at any time about your
          stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of
          data processing, and, if applicable, the right to correct or delete
          this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions
          regarding personal data, you can contact us at any time at the address
          provided in the imprint.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of
          your personal data. You can contact us at any time at the address
          provided in the imprint. The right to restriction of processing exists
          in the following cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we
            usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the audit, you
            have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
            personal data.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening
            unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing
            instead of deletion.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the
            exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right
            to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data
            instead of deletion.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have lodged an objection according to Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR, a
            balance must be made between your interests and ours. As long as it
            is not clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request
            the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data
          - apart from its storage - may only be processed with your consent or
          for the purpose of asserting, exercising, or defending legal claims or
          protecting the rights of another natural or legal person or for
          reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member
          State.

        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies have a variety of functions. Many cookies are technically
          essential since certain website functions would not work in the

          of user patterns or the display of promotional messages.
        </p>

          optimization of the website (e.g., cookies that provide measurable
          insights into the web audience), shall be stored on the basis of Art.
          6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR, unless a different legal basis is cited. The

        <h3>Server Log Files</h3>
        <p>
          The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores
          information in so-called server log files that your browser
          automatically transmits to us. These are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Browser type and version</li>
          <li>Operating system used</li>
          <li>Referrer URL</li>
          <li>Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
          <li>Time of the server request</li>
          <li>IP address</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These data are not merged with other data sources.</p>
        <p>
          The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
          The website operator has a legitimate interest in the technically
          error-free presentation and optimization of his website – for this
          purpose, the server log files must be recorded.
        </p>
        <h3>Request via Email, Phone, or Fax</h3>
        <p>
          If you contact us by email, phone, or fax, your request, including all
          resulting personal data (name, request), will be stored and processed
          for the purpose of processing your request. We do not disclose this
          data without your consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR,
          insofar as your request is related to the fulfillment of a contract or
          is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In
          all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in
          the effective processing of the inquiries directed to us (Art. 6 Para.
          1 lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this
          was requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data you send us through contact requests will remain with us
          until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage, or
          the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after the
          completion of your request). Mandatory statutory provisions –
          especially retention periods – remain unaffected.

          Sofern Sie in die Datenverarbeitung eingewilligt haben, verarbeiten
          wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten auf Grundlage von Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit.
          a DSGVO bzw. Art. 9 Abs. 2 lit. a DSGVO, sofern besondere
          Datenkategorien nach Art. 9 Abs. 1 DSGVO verarbeitet werden. Im Falle
          einer ausdr&uuml;cklichen Einwilligung in die &Uuml;bertragung
          personenbezogener Daten in Drittstaaten erfolgt die Datenverarbeitung
          au&szlig;erdem auf Grundlage von Art. 49 Abs. 1 lit. a DSGVO. Sofern

          Datenverarbeitung zus&auml;tzlich auf Grundlage von &sect; 25 Abs. 1

          Interesses nach Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f DSGVO erfolgen. &Uuml;ber die

          Abs. 1 lit. f DSGVO an der Weitergabe haben oder wenn eine sonstige
          Rechtsgrundlage die Datenweitergabe erlaubt. Beim Einsatz von
