        </p>
        <h3>
          General Notes on the Legal Bases for Data Processing on this Website
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you have given your consent to data processing, we will process
          your personal data based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR <br> or Art. 9 Para.
          2 lit. a GDPR if special categories of data are processed. In the case
          of an express consent to the transfer of personal data to third <br>
          countries, the processing is carried out based on Art. 49 Para. 1 lit.
          a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to
          information on <br> your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the
          processing will also take place based on § 25 Para. 1 TTDSG. <br><br>Consent
          can be revoked at any time. If your data is processed to fulfill a
          contract or to carry out pre-contractual measures, <br> the processing is
          based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data
          if this is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based <br> on Art. 6
          Para. 1 lit. c GDPR. The data processing can also be carried out based
          on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. <br>
          Information on the respective legal bases in individual cases is
          provided in the following sections of this privacy policy.
        </p>
        <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
        <p>
          In the course of our business activities, we collaborate with various
          external entities. In some cases, the transmission of personal data to
          these external <br> entities is necessary. We only disclose personal data
          to external entities if it is necessary for the fulfillment of a
          contract, if we are legally obliged to do so <br> (e.g., disclosure of data
          to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest according to
          Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR in the disclosure, or if another legal
          basis <br>allows the data transfer. When using processors, we only
          disclose personal data of our customers based on a valid contract for
          order processing. <br> In the case of joint processing, a contract for
          joint processing is concluded.
        </p>
        <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
        <p>
          Many data processing operations are only possible with your express
          consent. You can revoke consent already given at any time. <br>The
          legality of the data processing carried out before the revocation
          remains unaffected by the revocation.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and Direct
          Marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)
        </h3>
        <p>
          IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU
          HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA <br> AT
          ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO
          APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. <br>THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL
          BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS DATA
          PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU OBJECT,<br> WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR
          AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE CAN PROVE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE
          GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING <br>THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND
          FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE, OR DEFEND
          LEGAL CLAIMS <br> (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).
          IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU
          HAVE THE RIGHT <br>TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL
          DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO
          APPLIES <br> TO PROFILING, INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT
          MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL <br> SUBSEQUENTLY NO
          LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO
          ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).
        </p>
        <h3>Right to File Complaints with Regulatory Authorities</h3>
        <p>
          In the event of breaches of data protection law, the data subject has
          the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory
          authority. The competent<br> supervisory authority for data protection
          issues is the data protection officer of the federal state in which
          our company is based. A list of data protection<br> officers and their
          contact details can be found at the following link:

          >.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the
          basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over <br> to
          you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you
          request the direct transfer <br>of the data to another responsible party,
          this will only be done if it is technically feasible.
        </p>
        <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
        <p>
          This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the
          protection of the transmission of confidential content, such as the
          inquiries you <br> send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an
          encrypted connection in your browser's address line when it changes
          from "http://" to "https://" <br> and the lock icon is displayed in your
          browser's address bar. If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data
          you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
        </p>
        <h3>Encrypted Payments on this Website</h3>
        <p>
          If there is an obligation to provide us with your payment data (e.g.,
          account number for direct debit authorization) after the conclusion <br>of
          a fee-based contract, this data is required for payment processing.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Payment transactions using common means of payment (Visa/MasterCard,
          direct debit) are made exclusively via an encrypted <br> SSL or TLS
          connection. You can recognize an encrypted connection in your
          browser's address line when it changes from "http://" to "https://"
          and the lock <br>icon is displayed in your browser's address bar. With
          encrypted communication, your payment data that you transmit to us
          cannot be read by third parties.
        </p>
        <h3>Information, Deletion, and Correction</h3>
        <p>
          Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the
          right to obtain information free of charge at any time about your
          stored personal data, <br> its origin and recipients, and the purpose of
          data processing, and, if applicable, the right to correct or delete
          this data. <br>For this purpose, as well as for further questions
          regarding personal data, you can contact us at any time at the address
          provided in the imprint.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of
          your personal data. You can contact us at any time at the address
          provided in the imprint. <br> The right to restriction of processing exists
          in the following cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we
            usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the audit,<br> you
            have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
            personal data.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening
            unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing
            instead of deletion.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the
            exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims,<br> you have the right
            to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data
            instead of deletion.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have lodged an objection according to Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR, a
            balance must be made between your interests and ours. <br> As long as it
            is not clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request <br>
            the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data
          - apart from its storage - may only be processed with your consent <br> or
          for the purpose of asserting, exercising, or defending legal claims or
          protecting the rights of another natural or legal <br> person or for
          reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member
          State.

        <h2>3. Data Collection on this Website</h2>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          Our websites and pages use what the industry refers to as "cookies."
          Cookies are small text files that do not cause any damage to your <br>
          device. They are either stored temporarily for the duration of a
          session (session cookies) <br>or they are permanently archived on your
          device (permanent cookies).<br><br> Session cookies are automatically deleted
          once you terminate your visit. Permanent cookies remain archived on <br>
          your device until you actively delete them or they are automatically
          eradicated by your web browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some cases, it is possible that third-party cookies are stored on
          your device once you enter our site (third-party cookies). <br> These
          cookies enable you or us to take advantage of certain services offered
          by the third party <br> (e.g., cookies for the processing of payment
          services).
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Cookies have a variety of functions. Many cookies are technically
          essential since certain website functions would not work in the <br>
          absence of the cookies (e.g., the shopping cart function or the
          display of videos). The purpose of other cookies may be the analysis <br>
          of user patterns or the display of promotional messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies, which are required for the performance of electronic
          communication transactions (required cookies) or for the <br> provision of
          certain functions you want to use (functional cookies, e.g., for the
          shopping cart function) or those <br>that are necessary for the
          optimization of the website (e.g., cookies that provide measurable
          insights into the web audience),<br> shall be stored on the basis of Art. <br><br>
          6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR, unless a different legal basis is cited. The
          operator of the website has a legitimate interest <br>in the storage of
          cookies to ensure the technically error-free and optimized provision
          of the operator's services. <br><br>If your consent to the storage of the
          cookies has been requested, the respective cookies are stored <br>
          exclusively on the basis of the consent obtained (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit.
          a GDPR); this consent may be revoked at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can configure your browser to notify you about the use of cookies
          and allow cookies only in individual cases, refuse the <br> acceptance of

        <h3>Server Log Files</h3>
        <p>
          The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores
          information in so-called server log <br> files that your browser
          automatically transmits to us. These are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Browser type and version</li>
          <li>Operating system used</li>
          <li>Referrer URL</li>
          <li>Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
          <li>Time of the server request</li>
          <li>IP address</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These data are not merged with other data sources.</p>
        <p>
          The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
          The website operator has a legitimate interest in <br> the technically
          error-free presentation and optimization of his website – for <br> this
          purpose, the server log files must be recorded.
        </p>
        <h3>Request via Email, Phone, or Fax</h3>
        <p>
          If you contact us by email, phone, or fax, your request, including all
          resulting personal data (name, request),<br> will be stored and processed
          for the purpose of processing your request. We do not disclose this
          data without your consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR,
          insofar as your request is related to the fulfillment of a <br> contract or
          is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. <br> In
          all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in
          the effective processing of the inquiries directed <br> to us (Art. 6 Para.
          1 lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this
          was requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data you send us through contact requests will remain with us
          until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage,<br> or
          the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after the
          completion of your request). Mandatory statutory provisions <br> –
          especially retention periods – remain unaffected.
