          >Welcome to the help page for <p>Join</p>, your guide to using our kanban
          project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what <p>Join</p><br>
          is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.</span

        <h2>What is Join?</h2>
        <span
          ><p>Join</p> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by
          a group of dedicated students as part of their web development <br>
          bootcamp at the Developer Akademie. <br><br>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning
          "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
          work-in-progress, and maximize <br> efficiency (or flow). <p>Join</p> leverages
          the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects
          in an intuitive, visual interface. <br><br> It is important to note that <p>Join</p>
          is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for
          extensive business usage. While we strive to <br> ensure the best possible
          user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability,
          reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality <br> regarding
          <p>Join</p>.</span

            <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
            <span
              >When you log in to <p>Join</p>, you'll find a default board. This board
              represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do",
              "In <br> Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</span
            >

            <span
              >In <p>Join</p>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go
              to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the <br>
              required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
              tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</span

            <span
              >Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
              Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the <br>
              appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
              the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,
              etc.</span

              on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to <br>
              another.</span

              >Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
              list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from <br>
              the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
              action is irreversible. <br><br> Remember that using <p>Join</p> effectively
              requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the
              board reflects the <br> current state of your project. <br><br> Have more
